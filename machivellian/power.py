Empirical Power Estimation (:mod:`skbio.stats.power`)
=====================================================

.. currentmodule:: skbio.stats.power

The purpose of this module is to provide empirical, post-hoc power estimation
of normally and non-normally distributed data. It also provides support to
subsample data to facilitate this analysis.

The underlying principle is based on subsampling and Monte Carlo simulation.
Assume that there is some set of populations, :math:`K_{1}, K_{2}, ... K_{n}`
which have some property, :math:`\mu` such that :math:`\mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2}
\neq ... \neq \mu_{n}`. For each of the populations, a sample, :math:`S` can be
drawn, with a parameter, :math:`x` where :math:`x \approx \mu` and for the
samples, we can use a test, :math:`f`, to show that :math:`x_{1} \neq x_{2}
\neq ... \neq x_{n}`.

Since we know that :math:`\mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2} \neq ... \neq \mu_{n}`,
we know we should reject the null hypothesis. If we fail to reject the null
hypothesis, we have committed a Type II error and our result is a false
negative. We can estimate the frequency of Type II errors at various sampling
depths by repeatedly subsampling the populations and observing how often we
see a false negative. If we repeat this several times for each subsampling
depth, and vary the depths we use, we can start to approximate a relationship
between the number of samples we use and the rate of false negatives, also
called the statistical power of the test.

To generate complete power curves from data which appears underpowered, the
`statsmodels.stats.power` package can be used to solve for an effect size. The
effect size can be used to extrapolate a power curve for the data.

Most functions in this module accept a statistical test function which takes a
list of samples and returns a p value. The test is then evaluated over a series
of subsamples.

Sampling may be handled in two ways. For any set of samples, we may simply
choose to draw :math:`n` observations at random for each sample. Alternatively,
if metadata is available, samples can be matched based on a set of control
categories so that paired samples are drawn at random from the set of available
matches.

                    num_runs=10, test_kwargs=None):
    """Subsamples data to iteratively calculate power

    Parameters
    ----------
    test : function
        The statistical test which accepts a list of arrays of values
        (sample ids or numeric values) and returns a p value or one-dimensional
        array of p values when `numeric == True`; or a boolean value
        indicating the null hypothesis should be rejected, or a
        one-dimensional array of boolean values indicating the null
        hypothesis should be rejected when `numeric == False`. Additional
        keyword arguments can be provided with `test_kwargs`.
    samples : array_like
        `samples` can be a list of lists or a list of arrays where each
        sublist or row in the array corresponds to a sampled group.
    counts : array-like
        The depths at which to sample the data. If `bootstrap == False`, the
        largest count depth times the group ratio cannot be greater than the
        number of observations in each group.
    draw_mode : {"ind", "matched"}, optional
        "matched" samples should be used when observations in
        samples have corresponding observations in other groups. For instance,
        this may be useful when working with regression data where
        :math:`x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{n}` maps to
        :math:`y_{1}, y_{2}, ..., y_{n}`. Sample vectors must be the same
        length in "matched" mode.
    numeric : bool, optional
        Indicates whether `test` returns a numeric p-value or array of numeric
        p values (`numeric=True`), or a boolean (`numeric=False`).
    alpha : float, optional
        The critical value used to calculate the power.
    ratio : 1-D array, optional
        The fraction of the sample counts which should be
        assigned to each group. If this is a 1-D array, it must be the same
        length as `samples`. If no value is supplied (`ratio` is None),
        then an equal number of observations will be drawn for each sample. In
        `matched` mode, this will be set to one. If `bootstrap == False`, then
        the product of the `ratio` and a sampling depth specified by `counts`
        cannot be greater than the number of observations in the respective
        sample.
    bootstrap : bool, optional
        Indicates whether subsampling should be performed with replacement
        (`bootstrap == True`) or without.
    num_iter : positive int, optional
        The number of p-values to generate for each point
        on the curve.
    num_runs : positive int, optional
        The number of times to calculate each curve.
    test_kwargs: dict, optional
        Additional keyword arguments for the `test` which may include
        parameters like a dataframe of values or distance matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray
        The power calculated for each subsample at each count. The array has
        `num_runs` rows, a length with the same number of elements as
        `sample_counts` and a depth equal to the number of p values returned by
        `test`. If `test` returns a float, the returned array will be
        two-dimensional instead of three.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the `mode` is "matched", an error will occur if the arrays in
        `samples` are not the same length.
    ValueError
        There is a ValueError if there are fewer samples than the minimum
        count.
    ValueError
        If the `counts_interval` is greater than the difference between the
        sample start and the max value, the function raises a ValueError.
    ValueError
        There are not an equal number of groups in `samples` and in `ratios`.
    TypeError
        `test` does not return a float or a 1-dimensional numpy array.
    ValueError
        When `replace` is true, and `counts` and `ratio` will draw more
        observations than exist in a sample.
